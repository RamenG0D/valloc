# Valloc

this project is a virtual allocator (not really virtual but more on that later). it can be used to create and utilize memory in a program in a generalized way.

its primary purpose though was to allow a developer to stack or heap allocate some memory and then properly hand that out (like `malloc()`) for any purpose really.

# Documentation

you can use `cargo doc` to build docs yourself **or** you can find docs on github at []
